# Codebase Layout and Ownership

The source tree is intentionally split between three concerns:

- command surface
- data acquisition
- report generation

## Ownership Model

- `cli.py` owns the stable top-level entry point only
- `config.py` owns the canonical defaults model and flattened constants
- `command_line/parser.py` owns root parser composition
- `command_line/options.py` owns reusable option groups
- `command_line/subcommands.py` owns subcommand-specific parser assembly
- `command_line/runtime/dispatch.py` owns command routing
- `command_line/registry.py` owns the direct-command handler registry
- `command_line/handlers.py` owns user-facing command behavior
- `project.py` and `settings.py` remain compatibility views over `config.py`
- `data_downloader/` owns source acquisition and normalization
- `data_downloader/api.py` owns the public downloader package surface
- `data_downloader/collector.py` owns high-level data-collection orchestration only
- `data_downloader/requested_sources.py` owns source-selection normalization
- `data_downloader/boundary_sources.py` owns boundary reuse and fallback policy
- `data_downloader/context_collection.py` owns context-source execution into staged directories
- `data_downloader/context_collectors.py` owns the executable collector registry
- `data_downloader/source_registry.py` owns tracked source metadata only
- `data_downloader/staging.py` owns safe swap-in staging behavior
- `data_downloader/data_layout.py` owns generated data-root layout contracts
- `data_downloader/summary_writer.py` owns collection-summary serialization
- `reporting/` owns report and map generation
- `reporting/api.py` owns the public reporting package surface
- `reporting/service.py` orchestrates report and map builds
- `reporting/map_document/` owns the standalone map template and derived render state
- `reporting/context_layers.py` owns top-level context-layer orchestration only
- `reporting/context_point_layers.py`, `reporting/context_polygon_layers.py`, and `reporting/context_time.py` own map-layer shaping details
- `reporting/aadr_samples.py`, `reporting/aadr_schema.py`, and `reporting/aadr_localities.py` own AADR report loading seams
- `reporting/summaries.py` owns machine-readable report summary payloads
- `reporting/countries.py` owns country-list normalization for report workflows
- `reporting/staging.py` owns safe swap-in staging for generated publication trees
- `data_downloader/contracts.py` owns normalized data artifact names
- `reporting/paths.py` owns generated report-bundle artifact names

## Collector Shape

The collector path is intentionally split into three seams:

- orchestration in `data_downloader/collector.py`
- source metadata in `data_downloader/source_registry.py` plus executable registry in `data_downloader/context_collectors.py`
- staging and generated layout contracts in `data_downloader/staging.py` and `data_downloader/data_layout.py`

That keeps adding or reordering context collectors localized to the registry modules instead of spreading dispatch rules, boundary reuse policy, README rendering, and staging behavior across the same module.

## Why `reporting/` Is Separate

Report generation is downstream of the data collectors, but it is not itself a data source. Keeping it in a separate package prevents the downloader package from becoming a general “everything” namespace again, while still letting the reporting code be split into focused modules instead of one long file.

## Purpose

This page records the intended source boundary so later refactors can preserve the same structure.
