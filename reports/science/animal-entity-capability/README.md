# Which animal samples reach the map?

We compared the ten normalized species sample tables with the retained
[point candidates](../../../data/adna/final/atlas/animal_atlas_point_candidates.json)
and [map exclusion decisions](../../../docs/report/animal_atlas_exclusion_report.json).
The two existing per-sample sources form an exact, disjoint partition of the
1,468 normalized sample IDs. We keep those original decision rows as the
entity ledger instead of copying them into a second list. The
[reconciliation result](report.json) binds all 13 inputs by size and SHA-256.

| Map decision | Sample IDs | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| In 170 point features | 331 | Source-backed map candidate membership; no scientific admission |
| Excluded from point map | 1,137 | 378 unresolved locality, 409 without coordinate provenance, 326 failing the point contract, 24 with unresolved chronology |
| **Normalized foundation** | **1,468** | Every ID has exactly one map decision |

Eight candidate features carry a Nordic inclusion label and refer to 12
distinct sample IDs: Denmark five, Finland two and Sweden five. No Norwegian
animal feature occurs in this retained point surface; that is a product zero,
not evidence that Norway lacks ancient animal remains. Country labels and
map support classes do not establish source-country authority or qualified
biological review. The foundation still has eleven unresolved paper-link
rows, and neither the source capability matrix nor this result admits an
ecological, pollen or vegetation analysis.

The [producer](replay.py) checks the normalized IDs against both original
decision sources, refuses overlap, missing IDs, duplicate mappings and broken
sample lineage, then reports the joined counts. Reproduce into a new directory
from the repository root and compare `report.json` byte for byte:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python \
  reports/science/animal-entity-capability/replay.py \
  --repository . --output artifacts/jobs/animal-entity-capability-replay
